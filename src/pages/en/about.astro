  <p>
    I'm a mechanical engineer and HVAC engineering consultant based in SÃ£o
    Paulo, Brazil, with a passion for building efficient, user-focused
    applications. My journey in programming started in childhood with Flash and
    ActionScript 3.0, and has evolved into a career combining engineering
    expertise with modern web development.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a freelance developer, I specialize in creating applications using
    Next.js, ConvexDB, React, and TypeScript. I'm particularly drawn to building
    lean, anti-ERP solutions that solve real problems without unnecessary
    complexity. My engineering background gives me a unique perspective on
    system design and problem-solving.
  </p>

  <p>
    Currently, I'm working on several projects including Warehouse Watcher (an
    inventory control system for small businesses), educational platforms with
    interactive quizzes, and a modular ERP system for my HVAC company. I believe
    in creating solutions that a solo developer can maintain and scale
    effectively.
  </p>

  <p>
    Beyond work, I'm passionate about classical piano, tennis, and travel. I've
    lived in both the US and Brazil, which has given me a global perspective on
    technology and business. I also enjoy studying physics and mathematics,
    tinkering with IoT projects, and exploring new programming languages like
    Elixir and Rust.
  </p>

  <p>
    I've published scientific research and am always learning new technologies.
    Recently, I've been fascinated by ConvexDB for building real-time
    applications and am considering starting a YouTube channel focused on solo
    development. If you share similar interests or want to collaborate, feel
    free to reach out!
