      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Background and path</h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Graduated in Mechanical Engineering, I work as a consultant specializing
        in HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) in São Paulo. It's a
        field that requires technical precision and understanding of complex
        systems - skills I apply directly to software development.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        I've been programming since age 12, starting with Flash and ActionScript
        3.0. I went through Visual Basic, C++, Java, until reaching the modern
        JavaScript ecosystem. Each language taught something different about
        solving problems.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        The engineering + programming combination gives me a unique perspective:
        I understand both technical limitations and real user needs. This helps
        me create solutions that work in the real world, not just on paper.
      </p>

    <!-- Approach -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">How I work</h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        I'm a solo developer by choice. I like to control the entire process:
        from understanding the problem to delivering the solution. This allows
        me to maintain consistency and quality in every detail.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        My approach is anti-ERP: I prefer focused software that solves a
        specific problem very well, instead of trying to solve everything
        mediocrely. Feature creep is the enemy of usability.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        I prioritize stable and well-documented technologies. I don't follow
        hypes, I choose tools that will allow me to keep code running for years
        without headaches.
      </p>

    <!-- Personal -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Personal side</h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        <strong>Classical piano:</strong> I've been studying for years, mainly Bach
        and Chopin. Musical discipline helps with coding discipline. Both require
        precision and patience to master.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        <strong>Tennis:</strong> I play regularly to balance hours in front of the
        computer. Individual sport, like programming - success depends on your dedication
        and technique.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        <strong>Travel:</strong> I've lived in the US and obviously Brazil. Visited
        several countries, each teaches something about how different people solve
        the same basic problems.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        <strong>Side studies:</strong> Physics and mathematics out of personal curiosity.
        I like to understand how things work fundamentally. I also explore languages
        like Rust and Elixir - not out of immediate necessity, but to expand ways
        of thinking about problems.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        <strong>Home projects:</strong> Automation, IoT, servers. I like applying
        technology to solve small daily problems. It's where I test ideas before
        using them in professional projects.
      </p>

    <!-- Research -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Academic work</h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        I published scientific research during undergrad about energy efficiency
        in HVAC systems. The article is available on
        <a
          href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780444642417503220"
          target="_blank"
          class="link link-primary">ScienceDirect</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        The research experience taught me the importance of rigorous methodology
        and detailed documentation - things I apply to both engineering and
        development.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Future -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Next steps</h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        I'm interested in creating content about solo development - the
        decisions, trade-offs and lessons learned. Maybe a YouTube channel
        focused on developers who work alone and need different strategies from
        large teams.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        I also want to explore more ConvexDB for real-time applications. It's a
        technology that truly simplifies complex backends - exactly the type of
        tool that allows solo developers to create robust products.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        If you made it this far and identify with this approach, I'd love to
        talk. Always open to exchanging experiences and collaborating on
        projects that make sense.
