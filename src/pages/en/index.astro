      <h1>Hi, I'm Rodrigo 👋</h1>
      <p>
        This is my personal space on the web — where I share a bit of what I do,
        study, and create.
      </p>

      <h2>Who I am</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a mechanical engineer and HVAC project engineer in São Paulo,
        Brazil. Beyond engineering, I also work as a freelance developer —
        passionate about creating apps with <strong>Next.js</strong>, <strong
          >Convex</strong
        >, <strong>React</strong>, and <strong>TypeScript</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been programming since childhood (back in the <em
          >Flash / ActionScript 3.0</em
        >
        🎮 days), and today I always seek simple and well-made solutions that a solo
        developer can maintain. I'm a big fan of lean apps, <em>anti-ERP</em>,
        with real focus on the user and without "feature creep".
      </p>

      <h2>What I'm currently building</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          📦 <strong>Warehouse Watcher</strong> — inventory control system for small
          businesses, anti-ERP and simple to use.
        </li>
        <li>
          📝 Practice test platform with question bank and intelligent filters.
        </li>
        <li>🎮 Educational game with quizzes and animated map.</li>
        <li>
          🏗️ Modular ERP for my HVAC company, with proposal flow, contracts,
          inventory, and financial management.
        </li>
        <li>
          🌐 High-performance landing pages (Next.js + Astro) for clients and
          personal projects.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Other things I enjoy</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>🎹 Classical piano — I study and practice regularly.</li>
        <li>
          🎾 Tennis — hobby that helps me maintain balance between work and
          personal life.
        </li>
        <li>
          🌍 Traveling — I've lived in the US and Brazil, and visited several
          countries.
        </li>
        <li>
          📚 Studying physics, applied mathematics (personal curiosity and to
          refresh engineering knowledge).
        </li>
        <li>
          🛠️ Playing with automation, IoT, home servers, and infrastructure
          optimization.
        </li>
        <li>
          🎥 Thinking about creating a YouTube channel for solo developers.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Fun facts</h2>
      <p>
        I've published a scientific article in a journal — <a
          href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780444642417503220"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer">check it out here</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm also quite self-taught: I study languages like Elixir and Rust out
        of curiosity, I've worked with Unity, Three.js, interactive maps, and
        explore new stacks like TigerBeetle.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm always looking for ways to improve my app architecture, and recently
        I've been working a lot with <strong>ConvexDB</strong> to simplify real-time
        backends.
      </p>
