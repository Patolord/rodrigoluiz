      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">What I do</h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        I'm a mechanical engineer specializing in HVAC and a freelance
        developer. I combine technical engineering knowledge with modern
        development to create practical and efficient solutions.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        I've been programming since childhood (Flash/ActionScript 3.0 era) and
        today I focus on simple solutions that a solo developer can maintain.
        I'm a fan of lean apps, anti-ERP, with real focus on users.

    <!-- Philosophy -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Work philosophy</h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        I believe in software that solves real problems without adding
        complexity. Every feature needs to justify its existence. I prefer 10
        well-made features over 100 poorly implemented ones.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        As a solo developer, I prioritize technologies that allow me to maintain
        and scale projects alone. Clear documentation, simple code, architecture
        that doesn't become a nightmare after 6 months.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Combining engineering and development, I have a unique perspective on
        systems: I understand both the technical side and real user needs.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Let's work together?</h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Open to projects that make sense. I like to understand the real problem
        before proposing solutions. I prefer long-term partnerships over one-off
        jobs.
